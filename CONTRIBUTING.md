### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: developers needed--looking for contributions, check our road-map or talk to one of us for ways that you can contribute.
- **qa-needed**: if you have experience in quality assurance, your contributions here would be welcome!
- **documentation-needed**: help create documentation to make this project friendly to new users or new developers.
- **bug-high-priority**: check our bugs-list and see if there are any you are able to work on.
- **bug-low-priority**: (same as above)
- **help-wanted**: do you have any other ideas? feel free to talk to us and suggest other ways where you think you can contribute.

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
